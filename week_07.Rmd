Solo hacer resúmenes de los artículos. De los capítulos, NO. Máx. 1 página en total. Debería ser un parrafito por artículo (en plan abstract): han hecho esto, esto es lo que hemos aprendido, etc. Después, podemos poner preguntas, bullet points con otra info, etc. 


# Reading 1: Gordon and Roettger (2017)
Gordon and Roettger (2017) examined potential acoustic correlates of word stress in different languages. To do so, they created a corpus of 110 studies that included a total of 75 languages and varieties with different characteristics (genetic affiliation, tone, etc.) and distributed across the five continents. Importantly, not all the analyzed studies included the same acoustic dimensions and not all of them were similarly measured. The results from their cross-linguistic analysis indicate that there are different parameters that may signal stress, such as duration, F0, intensity, and spectral tilt, being duration the most statistically significant acoustic exponent of stress. These findings suggest that stress manifest differently across languages.
