# Summary 

+ **General topic**: Perception of L2 sounds 

+ **More specific**: The discrimination of English vowels by L1 Spanish - L2 English early *bilinguals* (learners)

---

# Some notes on speech perception

+ There is a **shift** from a language-general **to a language-specific pattern of speech perception** during infancy 

+ It may be due to a **loss of neuroplasticity** that accompanies normal neural maturation

+ The **Native Language Magnet theory** (NLM theory) tries to explain what exactly happens and why and holds that:
    + infants categorize sound patterns into a **“perceptual map"**
    + babies create **perfect examples of sounds** with a target area around each sound
    + these **prototypes** “tune” the child’s brain to the native language 
    + once a sound category exists in memory, “it functions like a **magnet for other sounds**”
    + the identification of L1 speech sounds become more robust; L2 categories may become difficult
  
+ Can this "perceptual map" (or sound map) be reversed according to the studies discussed in the lit. review section?

---
+ **Can this "perceptual map" (or sound map) be reversed** according to the studies discussed in the lit. review section?
  + **No?** **&rarr;** Bosch et al. (2000), Pallier et al. (1997, 2001), Sebastián-Gallés and Soto-Faraco (1999), Sebastián-Gallés et al. (2005):
      + **Differences** in the discrimination of /e/ vs /ɛ/ by early L2 learners of Catalan vs Catalan native speakers. SO early learners... 
          + are unlikely to perceive L2 vowels in a nativelike way after perceptual attunement to the L1 phonological system
          + and exhibit a lack of behavioral plasticity with respect to learning to perceive contrastive phonemes of an L2, even under conditions of early and extensive exposure

  + **Yes?** **&rarr;** Flege et al. (1999), Flege and MacKay (2004):
      + **Similar results** in a discrimination task of English vowels by low-L1-use and English ML groups (high-L1-use group differed marginally from MLs). SO early learners...
          + may closely resemble L2 native speakers, if they use their L1 infrequently
  
  + **Conflicting results!**

---
# The present study: Højen & Flege (2006)

+ **Previous research** showed two different patterns: 
  1. Early learners differed significantly from the control group (L2 native speakers) **&rarr;** They are unlikely to perceive L2 vowels in a nativelike way
  2. Early learners did not significantly differ from the control group (L2 native speakers) **&rarr;** They may closely resemble L2 native speakers, if they use their L1 infrequently
  
+ **Goal**: to examine the discrimination of English vowels by L1 Spanish - L2 English early *bilinguals* (learners)
  + But... What is the **novelty** of this study? 
  + And what is the **reasoning** behind this change in methods?

---
# Experiment 1

+ **Aim**: develop an AXB test that would result in higher (near-ceiling) scores for vowels heard as distinct phonemes and lower (near-chance) scores for foreign vowels that might be heard as belonging to the same category in the L1
  + **Why** do they do it? Why is this important? 

+ What is an **AXB test**?
  + A type of perceptual discrimination task
  + Participants listen to three stimuli: A, X, and B
  + They determine whether X sounds more like A or B
        
+ **Participants**: 
  + 45 English monolinguals
  + 3 native speakers of Danish

---
+ **Stimuli**: Danish nonwords (CCVC) with 4 vowel contrasts:
  + easy contrast: [uː] - [ɔ̝ː] -> /gl_s/
  + difficult contrasts: 
      + [e̝ː] -[e] -> /fl_s/
      + [iː] - [e̝ː] -> /kl_s/
      + [y] - [ø] -> /tj_s/
  + 3 conditions:
      + blocked (small stimulus range; declarative sentences)
      + mixed (large stimulus range; declarative sentences)
      + mixed/F0 (large stimulus range + variation in F0; declarative and interrogative sentences, different F0 patterns) 
          
          + **Why** do they include these 3 conditions?
                    
+ **Procedure**:
  + 64 trials x 4 contrasts = 256 AXB trials
  + 3 stimuli 
  + push 1-2 or 2-3 button (1-2 if 2 was like 1, 2-3 if 2 was like 3)
  + practice block with feedback

---
+ **Results**:
  + Danish MLs had higher scores in all conditions (easy and difficult)
  + English MLs had higher scores in the easy condition, and substantially lower scores in the difficult conditions, but still above chance:
      + Scores were lower in the mixed/F0 condition compared to the blocked condition
      + Scores were lower in F0 incongruent trials and higher in F0 congruent trials
      + No significant differences between the blocked and the mixed conditions **&rarr;** Potential effect of F0
  
  + What **condition** do they then decide to use in Experiment 2?

---
# Experiment 2

+ **Aim**: 
    + Analyze the discrimination of English vowels by adult L1 Spanish - L2 early learners of English
    + Compare it to that of English monolinguals (and Spanish monolinguals)

+ **Participants** (n=60): 
  + 20 L1 Spanish - L2 English early bilinguals
  + 20 English monolinguals
  + 20 Spanish monolinguals

+ **Materials**:
  + (Language background questionnaire)
  + (Production task)
  + Perception task

+ **Results**: 
  + **Between-group differences**
      + Spanish MLs:
          + The vowel pair for the easy contrast was heard as distinct Spanish vowels
          + Scored at or near chance **&rarr;** Did not perceive vowels as distinct phonemes for the difficult contrasts 
          
      + English MLs
          + Scored near ceiling for the difficult contrasts
          
      + L1 Spanish - L2 English BLs
          + Higher scores than the Spanish MLs at both ISIs 
          + Similar scores to English MLs at ISI=1000 ms
          + Slightly lower scores than the English MLs in [ʊ] - [oʊ] and [ɪ] - [eɪ] contrasts at ISI=0 ms
          + Non-overlapping scores for the three difficult contrasts at ISI=0 ms (individual BLs and Spanish MLs)

  + **Individual differences** among BLs **&rarr;** Some obtained scores below English MLs **&rarr;** AoE, L2 use, L2 exposure
