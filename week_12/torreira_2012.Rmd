# Summary 

+ **General topic**: Perception of stress among Spanish monolinguals
+ **More specific**: The acoustic cues and cue-interaction that Castilian Spanish speakers use to perceive primary stress in unaccented contexts

<br/>

# Some key concepts

+ Primary vs Secondary stress
+ Accented vs Unaccented contexts
+ Prosodic/Prominence hierarchy
+ Duration
+ Intensity
+ Spectral tilt

# The present study
+ 4 main goals:
  + Perception of stress contrast in unaccented contexts (no pitch accent + no vowel reduction)
  + Interaction between duration and overall intensity?
  + Same weigh for every cue? Same as production?
  + More reliability on overall intensity than on spectral tilt?

---
# Methods
+ **Participants**: 20 Castilian Spanish monolinguals
+ **Task**: listen and identify oxytone (agudas) words in unaccented sentences
+ **Stimuli**: 175 aural sentences **&rarr;** "Hola - saluda X contenta"
  + **Target words**: *mama-mamá* and *mimi-mimí*
  + Target words varied in **two bi-dimensional paroxytone-oxytone continua**: 
      + What does it mean?
      + How do the authors manipulate their stimuli? 
      + Could they have done it differently?
      + Why do they do it?
      + Why did they specifically choose duration, overall intensity, and spectral tilt as potential cues to stress?
      + Why do you think that the authors focus on the vowels [a] and [i]? Why unaccented contexts?

# Main results
+ Spanish speakers **do perceive stress** in reporting sentences **&rarr;** Stress can be perceived **in the absence of pitch accents and vowel reduction patterns**
+ Cues to stress depend on vowel type
+ Perception of stress is based on a **cluster of cues**, mainly duration and overall intensity. 
+ Importantly, cues to stress **depend on vowel type** and their weights changed according to the vowel:
      + **[a]**
        + main cue = duration
        + when duration cues are ambiguous, then intensity
        + both duration and intensity contribute to the perception in an additive manner
      + **[i]**
        + main cue = overall intensity
        + they do not rely on duration, even when intensity cues were ambiguous
        + no additive relationship between intensity and duration
+ Spectral tilt had no effects

# Some discussion questions
+ What might explain the differential perception of stress contrast depending on vowel type ([a] vs. [i])?
+ We can consider this study as a continuation of Ortega-Llebaria and Prieto (underreview?, 2009?) (discussed in the lit. review). What similarities and/or differences do the authors find regarding duration and intensity cues in the production and perception patterns?
+ What are your main takeaways of this study? 
+ What did you (dis)like about this study?
+ Why is this study important? 
+ How do the findings in this study contribute to our knowledge of stress perception/production?
