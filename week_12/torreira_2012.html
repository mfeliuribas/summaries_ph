# Introduction 

+ Phenomenon under investigation: /s/-aspiration

+ Aspirated [s] is found in many varieties of Spanish **&amp;rarr;** Western Andalusian Spanish (WAS)

+ Simple segmental rule: /s/ &gt; [h] **&amp;rarr;** .black[Question]: Is this rule representative of WAS? Why?

# Introduction 

+ Phenomenon under investigation: /s/-aspiration

+ Aspirated [s] is found in many varieties of Spanish **&amp;rarr;** Western Andalusian Spanish (WAS)

+ Simple segmental rule: /s/ &gt; [h] **&amp;rarr;** .black[Question]: Is this rule representative of WAS? Why?
    + This description is 'too simplistic'; there is a lot of variation:
      + It can be elided in utterance-final position
      + It is usually heard in word-final position before a vowel
      + It is coarticulated in different ways with the upcoming consonant (in preconsonantal position):
          + Gemination (in front of nasals, laterals, and other fricatives)
          + Long voiced fricatives (in front of voiced stops)
          
+ Torreira (2007a) and Torreira (2007b)
    + Realization of [h + voiceless stop] clusters with long pre- and postaspirated stop clusters as a dialect-specific feature of WAS

---
# The present study
+ RQs (I propose, not explicitly stated):

  + Are aspirated stops in WAS result from a coarticulatory process or from a segmental rule?
  
    + What are the effects of speech rate and stress patterns on closure and vowel duration?
    
    + What are the effects of speech rate and stress patterns on VOT?
    
    + Is there a negative or positive correlation between VOT and the sum of aspiration and closure duration?

---
# Methods
+ **Participants**: 3 native speakers of WAS (from Cádiz)

+ **Task**: Read some sentences

+ **Stimuli**: 60 sentences **&amp;rarr;** "Digo X para mí"
  + **Target words**: 
      + Bisyllabic verbs with infinitive forms ending in -ascar (*tascar*, *mascar*, *cascar*), -aspar (*raspar*), -astar (*pastar*, *bastar*, *gastar*)
      + 2 forms / stress patterns: *raspo* vs *raspó* **&amp;rarr;** Lexical stress (paroxytone vs oxytone)
      + [h + voiceless stop] cluster **&amp;rarr;** .black[Question]: Why did the author focus on this cluster?
      + 2 speech rates
      
  + 60 sentences x 2 different speed rates = 120 sentences per speaker
  
  + .black[Question]: Why do they decide to manipulate the speech rate and the stress placement?

# Measurements
  + Voice Onset Time
  
  + Vowel Duration
  
  + Closure Duration
  
  + Preaspiration duration


# Analysis
  + A total of 328 sentences were included in the analysis
  
  + Each speaker was analyzed separately

---
# Main results
  + **VOT values**
    + Differences among participants
    
    + M1 had longer VOTs than the other speakers, especially for [t]
    
    + F1 and M2 had shorter VOTs than M1
    
    + VOT values were higher on average than those reported for Andalusian unaspirated stops (Torreira, 2007a), BUT a "significant number" was short compared to other languages that use postaspiration as a contrastive cue in stops (e.g., Thai)

  + **Assessment of speech rate and stress pattern**
    + Vowel and closure duration were longer in slow speech rate and stressed syllables for all participants
    
    + So... large and consistent effects of speech rate and stress on closure and vowel duration

---
  + **Effects of rate and stress on VOT**
  
        * VOT values tended to be slightly longer at slow speech rates and in unstressed syllables
        * A series of ANOVAs revealed differences among participants as for the factors that affect VOT values:
            * F1: stop type and stress
            * M1: stop type, rate, rate x stress (only in unstressed syllables)
            * M2: stop type
        * The difference between short and long VOT was only statistically significant for unstressed stops for 1 of the 3 participants
        * Stressed stops did not show longer VOT than unstressed stops for any speaker (one speaker exhibited the opposite trend)
        * So... VOT values didn't seem to be significantly affected by rate and stress
        * So... long VOT in WAS voiceless stops preceded by aspirated /s/ doesn't act as an acoustic cue to the stop consonant
    
    * Trade-offs (compensación, intercambio) between VOT and aspiration + closure duration
        * A series of regression models
            * Statistically negative correlations between preaspiration duration and closure duration for participants F1 and M2
            * M1 similar, but not statistically significant
        * New regression models, controlling for the manipulated factors (they add them as covariates, is it the same as fixed effects?)
            * All speakers showed statistically negative relationships between VOT values and preaspiration + closure duration
                * No entiendo porq no hacen directamente esto
        * So... quite consistent negative relationship between VOT and preaspiration and closure duration -&gt; This negaative correlation meets the predictions of the coarticulatory account (of the occurrance of postaspiration in WAS voiceless stops)
        * In agreement with a coarticulatory account of postaspiration in WAS voiceless stops, they found statistical evidence of trade-offs between VOT and preaspiration and closure durations - Clearly observed for 2 of the 3 speakers (F1 and M2) when only the main predictor was included; clearly observed for all speakers when the manipulated factors were controlled for

+ Spanish speakers **do perceive stress** in reporting sentences **&amp;rarr;** Stress can be perceived **in the absence of pitch accents and vowel reduction patterns**
+ Cues to stress depend on vowel type
+ Perception of stress is based on a **cluster of cues**, mainly duration and overall intensity. 
+ Importantly, cues to stress **depend on vowel type** and their weights changed according to the vowel:
      + **[a]**
        + main cue = duration
        + when duration cues are ambiguous, then intensity
        + both duration and intensity contribute to the perception in an additive manner
      + **[i]**
        + main cue = overall intensity
        + they do not rely on duration, even when intensity cues were ambiguous
        + no additive relationship between intensity and duration
+ Spectral tilt had no effects

---
# Some discussion questions
+ What might explain the differential perception of stress contrast depending on vowel type ([a] vs. [i])?
+ We can consider this study as a continuation of Ortega-Llebaria and Prieto (underreview?, 2009?) (discussed in the lit. review). What similarities and/or differences do the authors find regarding duration and intensity cues in the production and perception patterns?
+ What are your main takeaways of this study? 
+ What did you (dis)like about this study?
+ Why is this study important? 
+ How do the findings in this study contribute to our knowledge of stress perception/production?
